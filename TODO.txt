Types of layers as modules.

As it stands things are pretty tightly coupled.. right pane stuff, service routing stuff. This should not be the case.

Each service interace type needs to provide:
  Right pane data access.
  Legend mgmt
  Download selected
  Sensible infowindow contents / filtering


Current types:
  Simple checkbox with adjoining legend (subsidence, grounwater boundaries)
  Radio-controlled. Services with the same layers can share checkboxes. Embedded legend (well data)
  Radio controlled, extra parameters, legends follow (level measurements)
  Multiselect, adds legend. Transparency and perhaps reordering controls. with legend.
